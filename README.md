# Variant Leaderboard

Leaderboard for Variant on Hacktoberfest.

Database using Turso.

Documentation on getting started might come. At some point. Maybe.
In any case, just ask Nikolai to ask Mikael to send someone the `.env` file.
It should contain something like `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ASTRO_DB_REMOTE_URL`, and `ASTRO_DB_APP_TOKEN`.

_If your sensitive to bad code, don't look inside `src/pages/index.astro`._
